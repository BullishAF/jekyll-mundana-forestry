DeFi analyst “BowTiedIguana” posted a [**series of tweets**](https://twitter.com/BowTiedIguana/status/1608653434387050496) on Thursday night pointing to blockchain data that they think is showing that Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX who was just released on a $250 Million bail a week ago, may have recently moved over $684,000 worth of crypto.

In August of 2020 Sam Bankman-Fried agreed to take over control of the DeFi exchange Sushiswap from the anonymous founder Chef Nomi and asked for control of the exchange be sent to his wallet address on the Ethereum Blockchain. According to “BowTiedIguana” the ETH that was in that address, was transfered to a newly created address and then within hours, that new address also received transfers totaling $367k from 32 wallets identified as SBF’s former crypto trading firm Alameda Research Ltd. + $322k from various other wallets.

All of the crypto was then sent to a Crypto Exchange in Seychelles or to the Ren BTC bridge which was also previously funded and operated by Alameda Research. Many people in the crypto industry have long speculated that SBF himself was Chef Nomi, the anonymous co-founder of Sushiswap.

Also coming into question in this situation is one of SBF’s bail conditions set by the Judge, which stated he could not open any new credit lines of more than $1,000 USD. Although as of now these are just accusations, if it can be proved that SBF did move the crypto, it’s still not known whether that would actually be in violation of his bail agreement.

One issue is that someone “moving” crypto to other addresses doesn’t necessarily equate to “spending” it and also if the assets were already in his possesion in the previous wallet, would creating a new wallet be considered the same as opening an new account. This is just the latest twist in what has been a captivating, drama filled spectacle since FTX, Alameda Research, and over 100 affiliated entities declared bankruptcy on Nov. 11th.
