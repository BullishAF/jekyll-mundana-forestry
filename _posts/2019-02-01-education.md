[**Coindesk**](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/29/fbi-investigating-3commas-data-breach/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines) said that two 3Commas users informed them on Thursday that they were contacted by agents from the FBI’s Cincinnati Field Office about the 3Commas API Keys leak.

For several months now many users have found that 3Commas had traded away funds on crypto exchanges they’d linked their 3Comma account to, without their consent. 3Commas however claimed these users were most likely phished and insisted that it’s platform is safe.

The API leaker insinuated that the 3Commas keys had been sold by someone inside the company, but 3Commas CEO Yuriy Sorokin refuted that claim in a statement released on Thursday:

> 3Commas stresses that it has found no evidence during the internal investigation that any employee of 3Commas was somehow involved in attacks against the API data. Since becoming aware of the suspicious activities taking place, we immediately launched an internal investigation. We will continue with the investigation in the light of the new information and also notify law enforcement authorities accordingly.

A 3Commas victim group, previously reached out to the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies to understand how their funds had gone missing. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) posted this [**Tweet**](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1608182790540902407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1608182790540902407%7Ctwgr%5Ef2176941b5418fff860510e6f787f5396a3d42c8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2F3commas-ceo-confirms-api-key-leak-following-warning-from-cz) on Dec. 28, stating:

> I am reasonably sure there are wide spread API key leaks from 3Commas. If you have ever put an API key in 3Commas (from any exchange), please disable it immediately. Stay #SAFU.

Binance had already dealt with an incident involving 3Commas on Dec. 9, when Binance cancelled the account of a user who complained about losing funds a day earlier. That user claimed a leaked API key tied to 3Commas was used “to make trades on low cap coins to push up the price to make profit.” Binance has declined to reimburse this user.
