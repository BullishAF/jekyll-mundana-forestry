Sam Bankman-Fried [**took to twitter**](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1608908562851598336) earlier today to refute reports that he’s moved over $684,000 worth of crypto to newly created wallets, exchanges and bridges. SBF says he does not have access to those accounts and he said it’s likely various “legs” of FTX had access to those wallets. He stated that if it wasn’t FTX who had access, he hopes someone steps in soon and offered to advise regulators on the situation if wanted.

> _None of these are me. I’m not and couldn’t be moving any of those funds; I don’t have access to them anymore._

> _I believe it is likely the case that various legit legs of FTX have the ability to access these funds; hopefully that’s what’s happening here. If not, hopefully one steps in soon to do so. I would be happy to help advise regulators on this if any wanted._
