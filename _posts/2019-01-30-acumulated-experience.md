The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed its charges against Avi Eisenberg. Eisenberg is charged with commodities fraud and manipulation over his $110 million October attack on Mango Markets. The charges were unsealed after Avi Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico on December 26th.

Eisenberg made the somewhat head-scratching decision and admitted in a twitter post to being the person responsible for the attack on Mango Markets. In his twitter thread, he said he believed that his actions were “legal open market actions”. The attack consisted of purchasing a large amount of MNGO tokens, Mango Market’s DAO token, essentially pumping the token’s price.

The MNGO token was then used as “collateral” on the exchange in order to borrow USDC with no intent to repay the loan which left Mango Markets with bad debt and users on the exchange unable to redeem funds. Although the initial exploit was for over $114 Million, afterwards Eisenberg proposed a settlement agreement with the goal of making all Mango Market users whole, as well as recapitalizing the Mango Market exchange.

The Mango Market DAO, voted in favor of Eisenberg’s settlement agreement and $67 million was returned to the exchange. Eisenberg kept the remaining $47 million and is now charged with commodities fraud and market manipulation. Mango Market isn’t the only exploit Eisenberg is accused of being behind, as he is also allegedly the exploiter behind DeFi lending protocol Aave being left in $1.7 million of bad debt as well as embezzling $14 million from Fortress DAO back in Febuary.
