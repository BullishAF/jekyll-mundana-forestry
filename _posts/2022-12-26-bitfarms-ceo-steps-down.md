Bitfarms CEO Emiliano Grodzki has resigned and will be replaced by COO Geoffrey Morphy. This comes after it has been a disastrous year for Bitcoin miners, much like every other sector in the crypto industry, contributing to some large mining firms to declare bankruptcy.

The Bitfarms announced Grodzki’s departure in a statement, adding that he will continue serving as a Board Director. Co-founder Nicolas Bonta will transition from Executive Chairman to Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Bonta credited Geoff for transforming Bitfarms from a wholly Canadian trading business into a global force. Bitfarms, a publicly traded, self-mining firm established in 2017 has 10 Bitfarm-operated mining farms located in Canada, the United States, Paraguay, and Argentina.

In the last year, Bitfarms’ trading price on Nasdaq has also seen a massive drop from $5.39 to $0.3760, a nearly 93% fall in value. Additionally, industry players say that mining operations have suffered due to the long sustained drop in the price of BTC, rising electricity costs, and an increase in the network’s total hash rate.
