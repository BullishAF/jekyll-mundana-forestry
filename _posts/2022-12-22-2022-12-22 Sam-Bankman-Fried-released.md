Sam Bankman-Fried the founder of crypto exchange FTX has posted the $250 Million Dollar Bail and has now been released. He will now be under house arrest at his parents home in Palo Alto CA, until he faces trial on eight charges of money laundering and fraud. Judge Gabriel Gorenstein stipulated that Bankman-Fried will be required to wear an electronic ankle monitor, which will be attached Friday after he is back in California.

The bond was secured by the equity in his parents’ Palo Alto, California, home, and a long list of requirements was included. He’s not allowed to make financial transactions for more than $1,000, can’t open new lines of credit, can’t leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance-abuse and mental-health treatment, according to the agreement.

Bankman-Fried will also have to secure the signatures of at least two additional individuals with “considerable means,” one of whom cannot be a family member, according to the judge. Whether he has obtained the two additional signatories remains unclear, but he must do so before a Jan. 5 deadline.

Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried’s first company, market-making firm Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, who was the co-founder of FTX alongside Bankman-Fried, have both pleaded guilty to federal charges and also admitted guilt in securities violations, according to statements from U.S. prosecutors and regulators late Wednesday.

The cooperation of Ellison and Wang, who both admitted to having active roles in the company’s fraud, will be key in the case against Bankman-Fried. They’ve admitted that senior management was aware of lawbreaking in the movement of customer funds between the two firms.
